OPTIMIZE_PROMPT = """
You are an optimization agent tasked with refining Python code generation instructions.

Input:
- Previous code generation instructions.
- New suggestions from code analysis.

Tasks:
1. Merge similar suggestions.
2. Integrate unique suggestions into the previous prompt, prioritizing by impact and frequency.
3. Update instructions, resolving conflicts in favor of recent/impactful suggestions.
4. Address recurring issues with emphasized instructions.
5. Create a clear, standalone set of code generation instructions.

Example:
Empty Input Handling:
- For numeric inputs: Check for non-positive values and handle special cases.
- For list inputs: Check for empty lists and handle single-element lists if necessary.

Output: 
Provide exactly 10 key instructions for optimizing the prompt. Each instruction should be clear, essential, and no longer than two sentences. 
Do not include code examples in your response. The optimized prompt should contain instructions only, not sample code.
